          advisor: It looks like you took 203 and 280. The most logical courses to take next are the other prerequisites for the CS degree.
          advisor: How many CS courses do you plan to take next term?
          student: I plan to take only one.
          advisor: Your choices include 376 which is a theory class, 281 which is the sequel to 280, and finally 370 which is about hardware.
          advisor: Are you more interesteed in programming, theory, or hardware?
          student: Hardware
          student: How difficult is each class?
          advisor: OK. Of these three courses, 281 is rated most difficult, then 370 (the hardware course). 376 is the easiest.
          student: Okay, looks like Ill take 370. Thank you!
          advisor: This makes sense. Bye!`
